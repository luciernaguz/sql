# For put in practice all about SQL

Following the instructios , I replicate the gitlab folder, clone the repository and insert the files as the instructions said putting inside in a new carpet EmployeeSQL.

Using the suggest link I do the ERD Diagram thats it is inside the carpet Images called: ERD Employee Database.png

![ERD Diagram](EmployeeSQL/Images/ERD%20Employee%20Database.png)

Then create the table with the respective constraint, with the csv files provided (files inside carpet named Data) import and filled the tables created and save all the querys in a file called Schemas_tables.sql.

After read again instructions and follow step by step and do the querys that are saved in the file Data_Analysis.sql

Bonus part, the most difficult to try solve the bonus part was the connection with the database then I think I complete this part. The images of the plots are inside in the carpet Images.

**Important Note , is necessary the password be added in the Jupyter Notebook for the connection.
